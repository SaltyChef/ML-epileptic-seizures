# Prediction and Detection of Epileptic Seizures ##Introduction This report presents the outcomes of a project undertaken as part of the Computational Learning course. The focus of this project is on the prediction and detection of epileptic seizures. Employing tools from Machine Learning, specifically those provided by MATLAB as an external application, we delve into the intricacies of the problem and discuss the results obtained from the trained models.

## Problem Overview Epileptic seizures pose a significant challenge in the medical field, and timely prediction and detection are crucial for effective intervention. In this report, we provide a peripheral view of the problem, outlining its importance and the potential impact of accurate predictions on patient care.

## Methodology Our approach involves leveraging Machine Learning techniques, utilizing the capabilities of MATLAB as a powerful external application. The subsequent chapters detail the step-by-step process followed by the authors to arrive at the presented results. We discuss the methodologies employed in training the models, the features selected, and the rationale behind these choices. Results and Discussion In this section, we delve into the conclusions drawn from our study on the detection of epileptic episodes through Computational Learning. Several crucial findings have emerged, shaping our understanding of effective methodologies and model architectures.

## Key Discoveries Class Balance and Error Weights: Implementation of class balance and the assignment of error weights (in the case of shallow networks) proved fundamental in achieving balanced and accurate results in the prediction and detection of epileptic episodes. This highlights the importance of addressing class imbalances for improved model performance.

### Autoencoders: Contrary to expectations, the use of autoencoders in our analysis did not demonstrate significant relevance in the obtained results. This finding emphasizes the need for careful consideration and evaluation of different architectural components.

### Shallow Networks, CNNs, and LSTMs: Shallow networks emerged as robust architectures for the detection of epileptic episodes, while CNNs exhibited prowess in both prediction and detection. LSTMs, particularly, demonstrated efficiency in detection tasks. The careful balance between these architectures, coupled with class balance strategies, stands out as a valuable guide for significant advancements in the detection and prediction of crucial events in epilepsy.

### Evaluation Strategies: The approach of calculating prediction and detection point by point, utilizing sensitivity and specificity, was successfully applied. Additionally, the "Seizure by Seizure" methodology provided a comprehensive and generalized assessment of model performance concerning epileptic episodes. This multifaceted analysis strengthens the robustness of our conclusions, offering a more complete and refined understanding of model performance in different clinical scenarios.

### Model Highlighting: It is noteworthy that the best-trained models are highlighted in green in the corresponding Excel sheets. This visual cue simplifies the identification of top-performing models, streamlining the decision-making process for model selection.

## Conclusion In conclusion, our study underscores the critical role of class balance, error weighting, and thoughtful selection of model architectures in the successful prediction and detection of epileptic episodes. The findings presented here provide valuable insights for researchers and practitioners seeking to enhance the reliability and accuracy of computational models in the field of epileptology. The combination of carefully chosen architectures and evaluation strategies contributes to the advancement of epilepsy detection, bringing us closer to more effective clinical interventions and improved patient outcomes.
